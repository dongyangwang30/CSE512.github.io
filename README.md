# An Ultimate Guide to Statistical Distributions: An Interactive Visualization Tool for Statistics Students

Our goal is to develop a visualization tool that synthesizes information on statistical distributions, and provide a concise way to learn them effectively. We have used Python, primarily with Altair, pandas, and scipy packages, to construct our visualization tool. The visualization contains three components, namely the distribution plots, a network graph, and text information. These elements work together to constitute the visualization tool, which explains the details about commonly used statistical distributions and elucidates the connections between them. As a result, the visualization tool will help educate statistics students, especially MS Statistics students who will soon take the theory exam.
